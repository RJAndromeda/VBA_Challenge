The two VBS files are Sub Challenge2_Geeson.vbs, which shows the code for the first part of the challenge, and the additional table, and includes notations on sections where I refer to others' work. For full references, see below. The second file, Sub Challenge2_allsheets_Geeson_Bonus.vbs, includes the modifications to ensure that the code can run across each of the sheets.

PNG files contain the screen shots for the challenge. The first one is Geeson_Screenshot_1, which shows the results of the code for 2018. The others are Challenge2_Geeson_Bonus1 and Challenge2_Geeson_Bonus2 show the results for 2019 and 2020, respectively.



In terms of reference materialL First and foremost, I've used information and code snippets from exercises and solutions from this week in class. In addition to this, I reviewed both https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/stock-analysis and https://github.com/davidjaimes/yearly-stock-market-analysis. The format function derived from information from DavidJaimes was " cells(counter, 11).value = Format(yearlyChange / openPrice, "#.##%")".
